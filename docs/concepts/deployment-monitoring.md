# Model monitoring

Model performance monitoring is a basic operational task that is implemented after an AI model has been deployed. MLRun:
- Monitors your models in production, and identifies and mitigates drift on the fly.
- Detects model drift based on feature drift via the integrated feature store, and auto-triggers retraining.

See full details and examples in [Model monitoring](../model_monitoring/index.html).
