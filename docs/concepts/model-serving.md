# Model serving

MLRun Serving allow composition of multi-stage real-time pipelines made of serverless Nuclio functions, including data processing, 
advanced model serving, custom logic, and fast access to a variety of data systems, and deploying them quickly to production with 
minimal effort.

High-level transformation logic is automatically converted to real-time serverless processing engines that can accept events or online data, 
handle any type of structured or unstructured data, and run complex computation graphs and native user code. 

Graphs are used to deploy and serve ML/DL models. Graphs can be deployed into a production serverless pipeline with a single command. 

See full details and examples in [Getting started with model serving](../serving/model-serving-get-started.html).
